# Prompt
The purpose of this Project is to simulate a BIOREACTOR WITH SUBSTRATE INHIBITION.This Project was done in five folds or steps:
i)Simulate the continuous bioreactor for a time frame with fixed inputs.
ii)Simulate the continuous bioreactor with a step response in flow rate.
iii)Fit baseline maximum growth rate, µmax (mu_max), given set of data.
iv)Fit growth kinetics for max growth rate µmax, the Monod Constant, K, and inhibition factor Ki.
v) Optimize Fin for best production.
Below are the links to every step respectively.
